                    Trincomalee campus has educated talented youth from diverse backgrounds and transformed them to high-quality professionals, academics and leaders. The efforts of my predecessor rectors, fully supported by councils, staff, students and society have elevated the Trincomalee campus to its present status.</p>
                <p>
                     Rapid changes in education, economics and environment in globe are inevitable. Thus our future students, staff and graduates will interact in diverse ways with a quite different world than today. With ambitious development and economic goals, national-level human capital development should strategically 
                     employ new technologies, innovations and entrepreneurship. The higher education landscape in the country are facing difficulties by rapidly developing technologies, democratisation
                      of access to knowledge and the formation of international platforms to address major global challenges.  Higher education will continue to be a vital force in promoting inclusiveness, building social cohesion and attaining economic resilience. Hence, the Trincomalee Campus, as a leading campus in Sri Lanka,
                       will face the challenge of living up to its vision and meeting regional and national needs with international quality. </p>

                <p>
                        My vision is to be a global centre of excellence in education, research and development, professional training with an aim to enhance the marine education and capacity of maritime industry in Trincomalee Campus. "My mission includes":</p>

                <ul>
                    <li> to provide world class education focused on areas across the value chain of the industry,</li>
                    <li> to empower students to excel in global industry through an interdisciplinary approach to learning,</li>
                    <li> to address the challenges of the industry and encourage innovation through cutting-edge research and collaboration with industry and </li>
